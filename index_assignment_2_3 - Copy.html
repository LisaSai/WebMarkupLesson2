    <h2>The story of Lisa Sai</h2>
    <p>Hi, 
        My name is Lisa. I live in Haarlem with my boyfriend and my two rabbits. I love reading and learning. I also enjoy running and exercising. 
    </p>
    <p>Last year I visited London. I bought a model of The Statue of Liberty there. It cost me &#163; 20. I love bringing memorabilia from my travels. When I went to Paris 5 years ago, I purchased a pack of great English biscuits. They were a bit pricey, around &euro; 200 but I thought they were worth it. I didn't get anything special on my trip to NYC. There was this cool figurine of the Eiffel Tower but I thought that &#36; 3 was too expensive.   </p>
